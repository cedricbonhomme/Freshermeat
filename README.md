### Configure and install the application

Before to begin you will need to install pipenv.  
It is recommended to first install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv),
then [pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi).  
And finally [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew) and
[pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) with pipsi.


```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/cedric/Freshermeat
$ cd Freshermeat/
$ pipenv install
‚ú®üç∞‚ú®
$ pipenv shell

(Freshermeat) $ npm install

(Freshermeat) $ export APPLICATION_SETTINGS=development.cfg

(Freshermeat) $ python src/manager.py db_create
(Freshermeat) $ python src/manager.py db_init
(Freshermeat) $ python src/manager.py create_admin <login> <password>
(Freshermeat) $ python src/manager.py import_projects var/projects.json

  files posted by the users through the forms or the API.
